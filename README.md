# [Oriyan Nadav - Portfolio Task](https://oriyannadav.github.io/She_Codes_Portfolio/)

The goal of my portfolio website project is to showcase my skills, experience, and creative work in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. I aim to create a professional online presence that effectively communicates my expertise and capabilities to potential clients, employers, and collaborators.

## Project Requirements

### Content
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

The portfolio website comprises several pages, including a home page, an about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. The home page features a captivating video background and a welcoming message that utilizes a JavaScript library for a typewriting effect. Moving on to the about page, it provides insightful information about my past and my future goals. Clicking on the portfolio page reveals a showcase of my recent studies and projects available for viewing. As for the contact page, it offers four clickable links to external websites, with each link represented by animated GIF icons that move upon mouse hover. Additionally, at the bottom of the page, a contact form utilizing the website Formspree allows visitors to send messages directly to my email inbox. 

Each page features a header with links to the aforementioned pages. On the left side, a clickable logo is linked to the home page, while on the right side, hovering over the links changes their color. Lastly, each page includes a heading that incorporates the JavaScript typing library and a footer.

Notably, the website has been designed with mobile responsiveness in mind, adapting seamlessly to various phones and viewports. The logo remains on the left side, maintaining its clickability, while the menu is positioned on the right side of the header. The menu is also clickable and employs JavaScript to display a dropdown bar when activated. Overall, the mobile view retains a consistent design with the desktop version, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly experience across different devices.


### Technical
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

The portfolio website I have created consists of four web pages, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. To ensure efficient collaboration and version control, the website is integrated with Git, allowing for easy tracking of changes. Moreover, the website is deployed on GitHub Pages, providing a reliable and accessible platform for hosting and sharing my portfolio with a wider audience.

### Bonus (optional)
- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [x] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extratricky!)

The portfolio website incorporates hover and active styles to enhance interactivity and user experience. The hover state is applied to the navigation bar, making the clickable links visually change colour when hovered over, allowing users to easily navigate to different pages. Additionally, on the contact page, the social media icons also have a hover state, providing visual feedback when users interact with them.

For the mobile view, the active state is employed to handle the navigation bar drop-down functionality. By utilizing a linked JavaScript file, the active state enables the navigation bar to expand and display the menu options when activated on mobile devices. This same JavaScript file is also responsible for implementing a 55% delay on the background video playback in the home page.

Within the HTML pages, a small script tag is included to incorporate a typing motion effect for each heading. This script enhances the visual appeal and engagement of the website by animating the text dynamically, providing a captivating and attention-grabbing element.

Overall, the implementation of hover and active styles, as well as the usage of the typing motion effect, adds interactivity and visual interest to the website, creating an engaging and immersive user experience.
